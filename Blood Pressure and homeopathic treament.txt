What are reasons that give rise to increase in blood pressure?There are several reasons that can contribute to an increase in blood pressure. These include:1. Aging: As people get older, the blood vessels become less flexible, leading to an increase in blood pressure.2. Family history: A strong family history of high blood pressure can increase the likelihood of developing the condition.3. Poor diet: Consuming a diet high in sodium (salt), saturated fats, and cholesterol can lead to high blood pressure.4. Lack of physical activity: Being physically inactive can contribute to weight gain, which increases the risk of high blood pressure.5. Excessive alcohol consumption: Drinking too much alcohol can raise blood pressure levels.6. Stress: Chronic stress can temporarily increase blood pressure, and over time this can become a long-term issue.7. Obesity: Being overweight or obese puts extra strain on the heart, leading to high blood pressure.8. Smoking: Smoking damages the blood vessels and causes an increase in blood pressure.9. Certain medical conditions: Conditions like chronic kidney disease, diabetes, and sleep apnea can increase the risk of high blood pressure.10. Medications: Some medications, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), oral contraceptives, and certain antidepressants, can cause a rise in blood pressure.It's important to note that many of these risk factors can be modified or managed through lifestyle changes, making it possible to lower or prevent high blood pressure.How can we treat cure blood pressure through homeopathic medical treatmentHomeopathy is a holistic form of medicine that aims to stimulate the body's natural healing process. It considers individual symptoms, constitutional factors, and the overall health of a person. While there are some homeopathic remedies commonly used for blood pressure management, it's essential to consult with a qualified homeopathic practitioner for personalized treatment. Here are a few remedies that might be prescribed:1. Belladonna: This remedy may be used for sudden, intense spikes in blood pressure accompanied by a flushed face, throbbing headache, and anxiety.2. Nux Vomica: It is often prescribed for individuals with high blood pressure due to a sedentary lifestyle, excessive stress, or overindulgence in stimulants like caffeine or alcohol.3. Lachesis: This remedy is typically recommended when there is a feeling of constriction in the chest, along with a tendency to feel worse after sleep or upon waking up.4. Aurum Metallicum: It is used for individuals with high blood pressure associated with intense emotions like grief, anger, or resentment.It is important to note that homeopathic treatment is highly individualized, and there is no one-size-fits-all approach. A qualified homeopathic practitioner will evaluate your complete health history and symptoms to prescribe the most suitable remedy for you. It is also crucial to continue monitoring your blood pressure regularly and consult with your primary healthcare provider for appropriate medical care. Homeopathic treatment should be used as an adjunct to conventional medical management, not as a standalone cure.What are standard blood pressure levels?The standard blood pressure levels are typically measured using two numbers: systolic pressure (the top number) and diastolic pressure (the bottom number). The measurements are reported in millimeters of mercury (mmHg). Here are the standard blood pressure levels:1. Normal blood pressure: A normal blood pressure reading is typically considered to be around 120/80 mmHg or lower. The systolic pressure should be less than 120 mmHg, and the diastolic pressure should be less than 80 mmHg.2. Elevated blood pressure: Elevated blood pressure is a new category introduced by the American Heart Association. It includes systolic readings between 120-129 mmHg and diastolic readings lower than 80 mmHg. This category indicates a higher risk of developing hypertension in the future.3. Hypertension stage 1: Hypertension stage 1 occurs when the systolic pressure ranges from 130-139 mmHg or the diastolic pressure ranges from 80-89 mmHg.4. Hypertension stage 2: Hypertension stage 2 occurs when the systolic pressure is 140 mmHg or higher, or the diastolic pressure is 90 mmHg or higher.5. Hypertensive crisis: A hypertensive crisis occurs when blood pressure readings reach 180/120 mmHg or higher. This is a severe condition that requires immediate medical attention.It is important to note that blood pressure levels can vary depending on individual factors, so it is always best to consult with a healthcare professional to understand your specific blood pressure targets and any necessary treatment or lifestyle changes.
